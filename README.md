## Stack

- üéØ **SvelteKit** - Frontend framework with Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI  
- üí≥ **LemonSqueezy** - Payments, taxes, and subscription management  
- üîê **Supabase** - Authentication and optional SQL database  
- üçÉ **MongoDB** - Primary database (when needed)  
- ‚ö° **Vercel** - Deployment, Edge Functions, and Blob Storage

## Quick Start

1. Clone this template:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kitstarter.git my-app
   cd my-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy the environment variables:  
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Fill in your environment variables in `.env`  
5. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Updating the Git Repository

Since this is a template, you'll need to update the remote repository to point to your own repository:

1. **Remove the Existing Git Remote**:  
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   ```

2. **Add Your Repository**:  
   Replace `your-repo-url` with the URL of your new repository:  
   ```bash
   git remote add origin your-repo-url
   ```

3. **Verify the Remote**:  
   Ensure the new remote is set correctly:  
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

4. **Push to Your Repository**:  
   Push your changes to the new repository:  
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Deployment

### Deployment Guide  

This project uses Vercel for deployment. We provide a simple script to handle the entire setup process.  

#### Prerequisites  
- `.env.example` file with all required variables listed  

#### Deployment Steps  

1. Make the setup script executable:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy-setup.sh
   ```  

2. Run the setup script with the desired environment flag:  
   ```bash
   # For preview environment (default)
   ./deploy-setup.sh

   # For production
   ./deploy-setup.sh --prod
   ```  

The script will:  
- Install Vercel CLI if needed  
- Log you into Vercel if needed  
- Deploy your project to Vercel  
- Set up environment variables for the chosen environment  

Each environment (preview, production) can have its own set of environment variables. The script will prompt you to add each variable from your `.env.example` for the selected environment. Development environment variables are handled locally through your `.env` file.

---

### Future Deployments  
Pushing to the main branch will automatically trigger a preview deployment. For manual deployments:  

```bash
# Preview deployment (default)
./deploy-setup.sh

# Production deployment
./deploy-setup.sh --prod
```  

---

### Troubleshooting  
If you encounter any issues:  
- Ensure you're logged into Vercel: `vercel login`  
- Check your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard  
- Verify your `.env.example` file lists all required variables  

**Remember:** Never commit your `.env` file to Git!

## Features

- üîí Authentication ready (Supabase)  
- üé® UI components with Tailwind + Daisy UI  
- üì± Responsive layouts  
- üõ£Ô∏è Route protection  
- ‚úâÔ∏è Email integration setup

## Environment Setup

You'll need to set up accounts with:  

1. **Supabase** - Auth and optional SQL database  
2. **MongoDB** - If you need a NoSQL database  
3. **LemonSqueezy** - For payments  
4. **Brevo** - For transactional emails  
5. **Vercel** - For deployment  

You can disable auth by setting `PUBLIC_AUTH_ENABLED` to `false` in your `.env` file, in which case you can leave the supabase keys empty.  

Add the respective API keys to your `.env` file.

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server  
- `vercel dev` - Start development server with Vercel

## AI Development with Cline

This template includes predefined prompts for Cline to help you develop faster with AI assistance. We suggest the first thing you ask Cline is to 
adapt the starter to your design requirements as it will be easier to do this at the beginning.
